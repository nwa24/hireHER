"XYZ provides online software and services for gaming. We design, develop, and host services for some of the world's biggest game franchises. We are a technology-driven company with a commitment to openness and independence. This means collaborating to solve analytical problems, the freedom to talk to anyone, and the best idea wins. We solve tough problems on a day to day basis, and our outspoken interns have a big impact on what we do. We've had ambitious interns commit code and have it running in production within the first three days of joining. We take the work seriously; ourselves, not so much. We dress casually, we have flexible hours, weâ€™re rockstars and we have kickass coffee.\n"
